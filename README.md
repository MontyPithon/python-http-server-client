# Python HTTP Client and Server

This project is a Python implementation of a simple web client and a series of web servers, built from scratch using low-level sockets.

## About This Project

This is a self-study project based on an assignment originally developed by Professor Peter Dinda and modified by Professor Steve Tarzia of Northwestern University. The goal is to understand the fundamentals of socket programming and the HTTP/1.0 protocol.
